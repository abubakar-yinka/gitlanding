# ðŸŽ‡ Restyling components

Each Gitlanding component has a `className` and `classes` prop that enable you to overwrite the current styles.

The prefered way to do this is with [TSS React](https://evt-garronej.gitbook.io/tss/).

1. Create makeStyles from TSS React.
2. Create the useStyles function and apply new styles to the components.
