# Advanced customization

A proper documentation is comming but in the meantime you can checkout how the website [sspcloud.fr](https://www.sspcloud.fr/) have extended GitLanding by:

* [Defining it's custome style](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/www.sspcloud.fr/blob/main/src/app/theme.ts)
* [Defining a React router](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/www.sspcloud.fr/blob/main/src/app/router.ts). Using [`type-route`](https://github.com/typehero/type-route)
* [Adding internationalization](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/www.sspcloud.fr/blob/main/src/app/i18n/translations.ts)

You can also checkout [`onyxai-ui`](https://github.com/garronej/onyxia-ui), the design toolkit onto which it built Gitlanding.

Note also that you can import any [Material-ui v5](https://mui.com/) component in your GitLanding project. They will fit in nicely and blend in with your theme.
